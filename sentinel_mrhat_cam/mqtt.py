    A class to handle MQTT client operations.

    This class manages the connection to an MQTT broker, publishes messages,
    and handles incoming configuration messages.

    Attributes
    ----------
    broker : str
        The IPv4 address of the MQTT broker.
    subtopic : str
        The topic to subscribe to for the incoming configuration file.
    port : int
        The port number for the MQTT broker connection.
    qos : int
        The Quality of Service level for MQTT messages.
    client : mqtt_client.Client
        The MQTT client instance.
    reconnect_counter : int
        A counter to track reconnection attempts.
    config_received_event : threading.Event
        An event to signal when a new configuration is received.
    config_confirm_message : str
        A message to confirm the receipt of a new configuration.

    Notes
    ------
    - The MQTT broker connection is retried up to 20 times upon failure.
    - This class requires the `paho-mqtt` library to be installed.
    - The class uses configuration values from a `static_config` module, which should be present in the same package.
