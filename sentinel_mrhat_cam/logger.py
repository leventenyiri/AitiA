    A custom logging handler that manages log messages and their publishing through MQTT.

    publishing them via MQTT, and managing the logging process using a thread pool.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath : str
        The path to the logging configuration file.

    Attributes
    ----------
    filepath : str
        The path to the logging configuration file.
    log_queue : Queue
        A queue to buffer log messages while there is no connection to the broker.
    mqtt : MQTT
        An instance of the MQTT class for publishing log messages.
    start_event : threading.Event
        An event to signal the start of MQTT logging.
    pool : ThreadPool
        A thread pool for asynchronous publishing of log messages.
